        <h2 align="center">"NASA is about to head back to the Moon, in a big way."
            <h3>After a long hiatus, two new lunar missions are set to head back to the lunar surface as precursors to the crewed Artemis missions.</h3>
        </h2>
        <article><p align="left">
            The lunar missions are proof-of-concept landers that will soon carry small payloads and experiments to the lunar surface. NASA awarded contracts to two companies, Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines, in May 2019 to carry out the landings under NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            Next up is Intuitive Machines based out of Houston, Texas. On October 11, 2021, their NOVA-C lander will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket for a landing at Oceanus Procellarum, near where Apollo 18 would have landed, had the U.S. continued the Apollo Moon program.
        </p><p align="left">
            In the meantime, the first uncrewed launch of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with 13 smallsat payloads is set for November 2021, with the first crewed Orion/Artemis 2 lunar flyby mission set for 2023. The first Lunar Gateway module is also due to launch in 2023, as is the first flight of Astrobotic’s larger Griffin lander, which would deliver the VIPER rover to the lunar south pole to prospect for water ice.

        <h2 align="center">"AMATEUR ASTRONOMER FINDS KILOMETER-SIZE ASTEROID"
            <h3>A grant from the Planetary Society enabled the recent discovery of kilometer-sized asteroid 2020 QU6.</h3>
        </h2>
        <p align="left">We have not yet found all the large, potentially hazardous near-Earth objects, as highlighted by the recent discovery of a kilometer-size asteroid.</p>
        <p align="left">Amateur astronomer Leonardo Amaral was scanning the skies on the night of August 27th, imaging a region in the constellation Indus, when he picked up a cosmic interloper: the asteroid 2020 QU6.</p>
        <p align="left">Amaral used the 0.3-meter reflector at the Campo dos Amarais observatory near Sau Paulo, Brazil. The observatory had received a recent upgrade thanks to a Planetary Society grant.</p>
        <p align="left">Turns out, 2020 QU6 is about a kilometer across — a surprising find given that most such large objects have been found and cataloged. </p>
        <p align="left">The asteroid orbits the Sun once every 3.26 years on an orbit inclined 23.5° relative to the ecliptic plane.</p>
        <p align="left">It poses no current threat to Earth, having passed within 40 million kilometers (24 million miles, more than 100 times the Earth-Moon distance) on September 10th.</p>
